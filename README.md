# 🧪 xUnit Testing with Code Coverage in ASP.NET Core

This is a sample ASP.NET Core project that demonstrates how to use xUnit for unit testing and how to generate a code coverage report using Coverlet and ReportGenerator.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✔️ Unit Testing with xUnit
- ✔️ Code Coverage Collection using Coverlet
- ✔️ HTML Report Generation via ReportGenerator
- ✔️ Works cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

- .NET SDK 6.0 or later
- Optional: Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code / JetBrains Rider

---

## 🚀 Setup & Usage Guide

### 📌 Step 1: Add Coverlet Collector to Your Test Project

Navigate to your test project folder and run:

```bash
dotnet add package coverlet.collector
```

This adds support for collecting code coverage during test runs.

---

### 📌 Step 2: Run Tests and Collect Coverage

Run the tests with coverage collection enabled:

```bash
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

This command creates a new TestResults/ folder with a coverage file in Cobertura format (e.g. coverage.cobertura.xml).

ℹ️ If your folder has multiple .csproj files, run:

```bash
dotnet test path/to/YourTestProject.csproj --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

---

### 📌 Step 3: Install ReportGenerator (One-Time Setup)

Install ReportGenerator as a global .NET tool:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool
```

---

### 📌 Step 4: Generate a Human-Readable HTML Report

Run the following command to generate a pretty HTML report:

```bash
reportgenerator -reports:**/coverage.cobertura.xml -targetdir:coveragereport -reporttypes:Html
```

This will output an HTML report inside the coveragereport/ folder.

---

### 📌 Step 5: View the Coverage Report

Open the generated file in your browser:

```
coveragereport/index.html
```

You’ll see detailed coverage stats — broken down by namespace, class, and even individual lines of code! 🎉
